# The Odin Project

This is a collection of code written following tutorials and projects completed while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Many of these files were organized after the fact, so there may be errors in the organizational structure (some work may be in the wrong folder also one or two Rails apps that reference shared resources may need to be revised).

In particular, each major project initially had its own repo. I have condensed them into this one collection. [This stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8396318) was a huge help.
